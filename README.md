# Bar-Chart-Horror-Rankings
I made a bar chart ranking 200 horror movies!

## Analysis
I made a bar chart comparing 200 horror movies ratings and only a few got a 100% rating. Not one went under 70%.

## Making Changes
1. All Data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/burlagaddashyam/200-best-horror-movierotten-tomatoes
*this is read in the tool pandas
*the library comes from matplotlib
*ideally when using other data files:
  **it should have around ten columns of data
 
2. I used replit.com for Python coding.
